    <h1>ðŸ¤– development is fun, but...</h1>
    <p>
      Software coding is fun. Ask any developer why they are compelled to a life
      of programming and theyâ€™ll all confirm this truth. Software application
      development professionals, hobbyists, students and even casual coders do
      it because itâ€™s essentially very enjoyable.
      <br />
      <br />
      Engineers love to program because they love problem-solving. They are
      attracted to the challenge of creating things, fixing things, improving
      things and making our lives and the world better and safer. Typically,
      they form a close bond with the systems, platforms and tools that they
      work with and get to know them far more intimately than many other
      craftspeople; but like any marriage, this is a relationship that can
      experience growing pains.
